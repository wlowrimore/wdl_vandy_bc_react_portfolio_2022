          Hi, my name is William Lowrimore. I am currently studying at
          Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Let me begin by
          saying, "This is the most excited I've been about my direction in life
          in a very long time!". I come from the banks of the Mississippi, where
          I was born and raised...Memphis, TN to be exact. I come from a family
          of musicians, artists, and (yes indeed) software 'techies'. I, myself,
          chose the path of music at a young age, and ran with it. Most of my
          professional years have been spent on the road and in recording
          studios. I toured, recorded and taught music. Music was my life!
          But...something was missing. I needed a change, a new start. So I
          picked up and moved on (a new city, a new life). I enrolled in
          Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I felt like I
          would be a perfect candidate to take on this challenge, express my
          love for problem solving, and to flex my creative muscles. I've
          enjoyed every second of it, and hope to make a very fruitful career of
          it. I am always learning, and always thirsty for knowledge. Finding
          this avenue is beyond exciting for me! I began this journey with only
          basic computer skills, and some graphic design experience, and
          now...well...let's just say, "I've come a long way!" With that said,
          please review my portfolio. You might find that I am willing and able
          to learn new skills, and adapt to new environments.
