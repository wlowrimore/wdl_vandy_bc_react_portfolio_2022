# William Lowrimore Portfolio

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-skyblue)<br />

## Description

This is my React.js Portfolio. It is a Single Page Application that features in page links. These links load the different components associated with the tabs in the navigation section of the header.<br><br> You will learn a little about who I am and where I come from in the "About Me" section.<br><br> The "Portfolio" section showcases some of my work that I have completed over the course of six months at the Vanderbilt University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Each project featured in the "Portfolio" section are equipped with links to that respective project's Github Repository, as well as the live site.<br><br> The "Contact" section is set up and ready for a future event which will email me the user's message, along with their name and email address (for now the input information is logged to the console).<br><br> Finally, the "Resume" section features my resume with a link to download it in a PDF format for printing.<br><br> The UI was created using, almost completely, vanilla and advanced CSS. Each section features overflow scrolling with hidden scroll bars. One final little "cherry on top" is that I created my very own favicon that you will see in the brower's tab.
